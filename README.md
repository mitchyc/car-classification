# Car Classification

This project was developed in 2018 as the final project in my AIkademi mentorship.

The model produced in train.py uses a convolutional neural network to identify, localise and annotate cars in a given image. The model is trained on a dataset not publically available, however should be usable with any large dataset of annotated car images.
